 Mimetic operators of order greater than two can be represented in a _compact form_ by factorizing the original matrices. By doing this, we can attain higher orders of accuracy using the minimal stencil. For example, in this [article](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cam.2015.01.040) the authors used compact representations for a problem of acoustic wave propagation.
