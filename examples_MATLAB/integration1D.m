% This program performs numerical integration using mimetic quadratures.
% In this problem, we only use the weights from matrix Q, but for context:
% Q and P are positive definite diagonal weight matrices.
% Their dimensions must allow the following operations:
%   Q*D,   P*G,   and   G'*P
% And the mimetic boundary operator is obtained by:
%   B = Q*D + G'*P

addpath('../mole_MATLAB');

% Domain limits
west = -5;
east = 5;

% Discretization parameters
k = 2;      % Order of mimetic quadrature
m = 50;     % Number of cells
dx = (east-west)/m;

% 1D staggered grid (cell centers)
grid = [west west+dx/2 : dx : east-dx/2 east];

% Function to integrate
fun = @(x) (1-x.^2).*exp(-x.^2/2);  % Ricker wavelet
f = fun(grid);

% Approximate the integral using Q's weights
w = weightsQ(k, m, dx);
w(1) = 0; w(end) = 0;
F = f*w;

% Exact integral for comparison
exact = integral(fun, west, east);

% Trapezoidal rule approximation
trapz_approx = trapz(grid, f);

% Output results
fprintf('Mimetic : %.6f\n', F);
fprintf('Exact   : %.6f\n', exact);
fprintf('trapz   : %.6f\n', trapz_approx);
