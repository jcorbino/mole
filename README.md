MOLE: Mimetic Operators Library Enhanced
========================================


1: Description
--------------

MOLE is a high-quality (C++ & MATLAB/Octave) library that implements 
high-order mimetic operators to solve partial differential equations. 
It provides discrete analogs of the most common vector calculus operators: 
Gradient, Divergence, Laplacian, Bilaplacian, and Curl. These operators (highly sparse matrices) act 
on staggered grids (uniform, non-uniform, curvilinear) and satisfy local and 
global conservation laws.

Mathematics is based on the work of [Corbino and Castillo, 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cam.2019.06.042). 
However, the user may find helpful previous publications, such as [Castillo and Grone, 2003](https://doi.org/10.1137/S0895479801398025),
in which similar operators were derived using a matrix analysis approach.


2: Licensing
------------

MOLE is distributed under a GNU General Public License; please refer to the _LICENSE_ 
file for more details.


3: Installation (Linux)
-----------------------

To use MOLE (C++ version), you need to have _Armadillo C++_ <http://arma.sourceforge.net>, _SuperLU_ 
<https://portal.nersc.gov/project/sparse/superlu>, and _OpenBLAS_ <https://www.openblas.net> installed on your computer.

Assuming a working installation of _SuperLU_ (`sudo apt install libsuperlu-dev` or `sudo yum install SuperLU-devel`), and _OpenBLAS_ (`sudo apt install libopenblas-dev` or `sudo yum install openblas-devel`), follow these steps:

`wget https://sourceforge.net/projects/arma/files/armadillo-12.6.6.tar.xz`

`tar xvf armadillo-12.6.6.tar.xz`

`cd armadillo-12.6.6`

**NOTE:** We suggest to use the latest stable version.

Define `ARMA_USE_SUPERLU` and `ARMA_USE_OPENMP` in `include/armadillo_bits/config.hpp`. Make sure that you have `cmake` and `g++` installed before executing:

`./configure`

`make`

This will create `libarmadillo.so`.

Now go to `mole/` and build MOLE via:

`ARMA=PATH_TO_ARMADILLO_FOLDER make`

Or simply:

`make`

if _Armadillo_ was installed via `sudo apt install libarmadillo-dev` or `sudo yum install armadillo-devel`.

A static library named `libmole.a` will be created after the previous step. From this point, you need to include `mole.h` 
in your projects, specify the location of `libmole.a` to the linker. For the users interested in building MOLE as a _shared library_, specify `make SHARED_LIB=1`. Make sure to include `mole_C++` directory in `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` (`export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/full/path/to/mole_C++`) so the loader can find the library at runtime.

**For our library's MATLAB/Octave version, the only dependency is to have MATLAB/Octave installed**.
The two implementations of MOLE (C++ & MATLAB/Octave) are independent; you don't need
to build the C++ version if you are just interested in using MOLE from MATLAB/Octave.


4: Running Examples & Tests
---------------------------

Here are instructions on how to run the provided examples and tests for both the C++ and MATLAB versions of the library to help you quickly get started with MOLE.

* **tests_C++:**
These tests, which are automatically executed upon constructing the library's C++ version, play a crucial role in verifying the correct installation of MOLE and its dependencies. There are four tests in total.

* **tests_MATLAB:**
We encourage MATLAB users to execute these tests before using MOLE by entering the `tests_MATLAB` directory and executing `run_tests.m` from MATLAB. These tests are analogous to those contained in `tests_C++`.

* **examples_C++:**
These will be automatically built after calling `make`. We encourage C++ users to make this their entry point to familiarize themselves with this library version. The four examples are self-contained and properly documented, and they solve typical PDEs.

* **examples_MATLAB:**
Most of our examples are provided in the MATLAB scripting language. There are over 30 examples, ranging from linear one-dimensional PDEs to highly nonlinear multidimensional PDEs.


5: Documentation
----------------

The folder `doc_MATLAB` contains generated documentation about the MATLAB/Octave API.
It was generated with a tool called [_m2html_](https://www.gllmflndn.com/software/matlab/m2html). However, for a quick start on MOLE's MATLAB/Octave version, we recommend starting with this short [guide](https://github.com/jcorbino/mole/blob/master/CSRC%20Report%20on%20MOLE.pdf).

For C++ users, we provide a short [guide](https://github.com/jcorbino/mole/blob/master/MOLE_C%2B%2B_Quick_Guide.pdf) to MOLE's C++ flavor. However, for those in need of more details to interact with the library, we suggest to follow these instructions:

To generate the C++ documentation, execute:

`doxygen Doxyfile` (requires _Doxygen_ and _Graphviz_)

this will create a folder called `doc_C++` containing a set of _html_ files. Please refer to the _index.html_ file 
to start browsing the documentation.

**NOTE:**
Performing non-unary operations involving operands constructed over different grids may lead to unexpected results. While MOLE allows such operations without throwing errors, users must exercise caution when manipulating operators across different grids.


6: Community Guidelines
