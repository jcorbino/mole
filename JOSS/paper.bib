These operators can be constructed to high orders of accuracy and maintain the physical properties of the problem under consideration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our scheme by modeling a lock release in 3D Cartesian coordinates, then extend our techniques to 3D curvilinear grids. The resulting scheme allows for simple and efficient computation of fluid processes on curvilinear grids, which allows us to solve problems in more complex regions while minimizing the restrictions of finite difference methods.}

  abstractNote = {This SAND report documents CIS Late Start LDRD Project 22-0311, "Differential geometric approaches to momentum-based formulations for fluids". The project primarily developed geometric mechanics formulations for momentum-based descriptions of nonrelativistic fluids, utilizing a differential geometry/exterior calculus treatment of momentum and a space+time splitting. Specifically, the full suite of geometric mechanics formulations (variational/Lagrangian, Lie-Poisson Hamiltonian and Curl-Form Hamiltonian) were developed in terms of exterior calculus using vector-bundle valued differential forms. This was done for a fairly general version of semi-direct product theory sufficient to cover a wide range of both neutral and charged fluid models, including compressible Euler, magnetohydrodynamics and Euler-Maxwell. As a secondary goal, this project also explored the connection between geometric mechanics formulations and the more traditional Godunov form (a hyperbolic system of conservation laws). Unfortunately, this stage did not produce anything particularly interesting, due to unforeseen technical difficulties. There are two publications related to this work currently in preparation, and this work will be presented at SIAM CSE 23, at which the PI is organizing a mini-symposium on geometric mechanics formulations and structure-preserving discretizations for fluids. The logical next step is to utilize the exterior calculus based understanding of momentum coupled with geometric mechanics formulations to develop (novel) structure-preserving discretizations of momentum. This is the main subject of a successful FY23 CIS LDRD "Structure-preserving discretizations for momentum-based formulations of fluids".},

  abstract = {This thesis presents the beginnings of a theory of discrete exterior calculus (DEC). Our approach is to develop DEC using only discrete combinatorial and geometric operations on a simplicial complex and its geometric dual. The derivation of these may require that the objects on the discrete mesh, but not the mesh itself, are interpolated. Our theory includes not only discrete equivalents of differential forms, but also discrete vector fields and the operators acting on these objects. Definitions are given for discrete versions of all the usual operators of exterior calculus. The presence of forms and vector fields allows us to address their various interactions, which are important in applications. In many examples we find that the formulas derived from DEC are identical to the existing formulas in the literature. We also show that the circumcentric dual of a simplicial complex plays a useful role in the metric dependent part of this theory. The appearance of dual complexes leads to a proliferation of the operators in the discrete theory. One potential application of DEC is to variational problems which come equipped with a rich exterior calculus structure. On the discrete level, such structures will be enhanced by the availability of DEC. One of the objectives of this thesis is to fill this gap. There are many constraints in numerical algorithms that naturally involve differential forms. Preserving such features directly on the discrete level is another goal, overlapping with our goals for variational problems. In this thesis we have tried to push a purely discrete point of view as far as possible. We argue that this can only be pushed so far, and that interpolation is a useful device. For example, we found that interpolation of functions and vector fields is a very convenient. In future work we intend to continue this interpolation point of view, extending it to higher degree forms, especially in the context of the sharp, Lie derivative and interior product operators. Some preliminary ideas on this point of view are presented in the thesis. We also present some preliminary calculations of formulas on regular nonsimplicial complexes.},
